## Background

In software construction, design pattern is a common approach when designing your program. Besides making the design process more efficient, using design pattern to design your program also allow you to determine the tradeoff of a particular design, as the pros and cons of design patterns are studied.

Compared to OOP in which the well-known design patterns are documented clearly by the GOF book, the design patterns for React component are still in flux. However, there are a few patterns that had emerged and employed by many React developers today, i.e.:

1.  Container-presenter
2.  Compound component
3.  Higher order component
4.  Render props

This article aims to explain the container-presenter pattern.
