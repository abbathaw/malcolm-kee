## Disclaimer

This is content of the Seth Godin's book, The Icarus Deception. I've bought the book, and I typed here just for myself to learn english by handtyping the content. If you read this, <a href="mailto:malcolm.keeweesiong@gmail.com">let me know how you've found the link</a>.

## Why Make Art?

Because you must. The new connected economy demands it and will reward you for nothing else.

Because you can. Art is what it is to be human.

## The Icarus Deception

Just south of the Greek Island of Samos lies the Icarian Sea. Legend has it that this is where Icarus died &mdash; a victim of this hubris.

His father, Daedalus, was a master craftman. Banished to prison for sabotaging the work of King Minos (captor of the Minotaur), Daedalus created a brilliant escape plot, described in the myth that we were told as children.

He fashioned a set of wings for himself and his son. After affixing the wings with wax, they set out to escape. Daedalus warns Icarus not to fly too close to the sun. Entranced by his magical ability to fly, Icarus disobeyed and flew too high. We all know what happened next: the wax melted, and Icarus, the beloved son, lost his wings, tumbled into the sea, and died.

The lesson of the story: Don't disobey the King. Don't disobey your dad. Don't imagine that you're better than you are, and most of all, don't ever believe that you have the ability to do what a god might do.

The part of the myth that you weren't told: In addition to telling Icarus not to fly too high, Deadalus instructed his son not to fly too low, too close to the sea, as the water would ruin the lift in this wings.

Society has altered the myth, encouraging us to forget the part about the sea, and created a culture where we constantly remind one another about the danger of standing up, standing out, and making a ruckus. Industrialist have made hubris a cardinal sin but conveniently ignored a far more common failing, settling for too little.

It's far more dangerous to fly too low than far too high, because it feels _safe_ to fly too low. We settle for low expectations and small dreams and guarantee ourselves less than what we are capable of. By flying too low, we shortchange not only ourselves but also those who depend on us or might benefit from our work. We're so obssessed about the risk of shining brightly that we've traded in everything that matters to avoid it.

The path that's available to each of us is neither reckless stupidity nor mindless compliance. No, the path that's available to us is to be human, to do art, and to fly far higher than we've been taught is possible. We've built a world where it's possible to fly higher than ever, and the tragedy is that we've been seduced into believing that we ought to fly ever lower instead.
