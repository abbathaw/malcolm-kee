Welcome!

## Why Gatsby

Before we jump into learning how to write code in Gatsby, let's take a step back and see what's the problem it is trying to solve.

### Before: Traditional CMS

Typically, websites are usually managed with content-management system (CMS) like Wordpress and Drupal. CMS allows anyone with basic HTML & CSS knowledge to update the website contents such as text or images without writing any code.

However, using CMS comes with few drawbacks:

1. use the old frontend paradigm
   - states are coupled with DOM
   - slow, manual DOM manipulation
   - document-based sites. Dynamic behavior (go to different page, submit a form) usually involves a full-page reload
   - in other words, many improvements that comes with modern frontend frameworks (e.g. virtual-dom, proper state-management, hot reloading) are not available
1. performance need to be manually managed and hand-tweaked
1. manual content and data migration required when data is available from multiple sources

### After: Gatsby

Gatsby is created to solve these problems:

1. utilize modern frontend technologies (webpack, React, SCSS, GraphQL) that gives you good developer experience and scaleable code management
1. automated performance tuning, e.g. inline critical assets, image optimization, lazy-loading and prefetch contents
1. pull data from anywhere with GraphQL. You can pull data from any API that expose data (including CMS such as Wordpress/Contentful or third-party services such as GitHub or Shopify), or databases (MongoDB/MySQL). You owns your data, and Gatsby allows you to present your data in the format you wish.

In the meantime, content creator can still manage the content via CMS.

How to utilize those features from Gatsby is the goal of this workshop.

## Workshop Agenda

- Introduction to Concepts in Gatsby
- Create Pages in Gatsby
- Use Gatsby Source Plugins to pull data into our sites
- Dynamically Create Pages from data
- Use Gatsby to optimize our image automatically

## Expectation

To get most from this workshop, it's advised that you:

1. before the workshop, read and complete [the setup instructions][gatsby-setup].
1. during the workshop, instead of listening passively, follow along the setup.
1. think how you can apply the knowledge you learn in your personal projects or works. Ask if you have difficulty relates them.
