Welcome!

## Why Gatsby

Before we jump into learning how to write code in Gatsby, let's take a step back and see what's the problem it is trying to solve.

Problem of website maintained by traditional CMS, and why they don't use frontend frameworks.

Gatsby gives you the best of both worlds.

Compared to sites that is managed using traditional CMS, modern frontend frameworks like React/Angular allows us to build a more dynamic sites. Besides, compared to the traditional way of maintaining your sites by copy-pasting markup, frontend frameworks allows you to create reusable components.

Nonetheless, frontend frameworks comes with a few drawbacks.

- increase our web page size, making the site slower to load
- highly dependent on JavaScript make our site fragile. Compared to HTML/CSS, where invalid tags/values will be ignored gracefully, as a programming language JavaScript will not run at all if browser encounter any problem parsing it.
