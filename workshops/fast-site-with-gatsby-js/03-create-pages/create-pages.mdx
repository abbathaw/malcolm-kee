## Setup Gatsby Project

```bash
mkdir learn-gatsby
cd learn-gatsby
npm init --y
npm install react react-dom gatsby
```

- `mkdir` is the command to create a folder in bash command prompt. It's equivalent to right click on File Explorer > New Folder.
- `cd` is change directory. `cd learn-gatsby` is equivalent to double click the "learn-gatsby" folder.
- `npm init` is an utility command to start a new projects, which is actually creating a `package.json` file in current folder. By default it will ask you few questions that you need to reply one-by-one, but I am lazy and add the `--y` flag to automatically answer `Yes` for all the questions.
- Finally, `npm install` is used to install third-party libraries for your project. It will download the libraries and put them in `node_modules` folder and add the libraries' name and version in the `package.json` file.

```bash
touch .gitignore
```

```text fileName=.gitignore
.cache
node_modules
/public
```

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

## Create First Page

```bash
mkdir -p src/pages
touch src/pages/index.js
```

```jsx fileName=src/pages/index.js
import React from 'react';

const HomePage = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Welcome to Malcolm Kee's Website</h1>
      <p>crafted with tears and love.</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default HomePage;
```

```json fileName=package.json highlightedLines=7
{
  "name": "learn-gatsby",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
