## Using Gatsby Plugin

![Plugins can be used to enhance build process of Gatsby](gatsbyjs-overview-highlight-build.png)

Gatsby plugins are how we customize Gatsby site to fit our specific use case.

Gatsby plugins can:

- add external data or content (this kind of plugin is known as source plugin, which will be covered [later](/fast-site-with-gatsby-js/source-plugin))
- transform data (this kind of plugin is known as transformer plugin, which will also be covered [later](/fast-site-with-gatsby-js/transformer-plugin))
- customize the build process (what we will do now)

In this exercise, we're going to configure our Gatsby to process [Sass].

```bash
touch gatsby-config.js
npm install node-sass gatsby-plugin-sass
```

```javascript fileName=gatsby-config.js
module.exports = {
  plugins: ['gatsby-plugin-sass'],
};
```

```bash
touch src/_constants.scss
```

```scss fileName=src/_constants.scss
$space: 8px;
$primary-color: rgb(102, 51, 153);
$max-width: 1020px;
```
