Welcome!

This workshop is a brief introduction to React JS.

It takes a problem-solving centered approach, whereby you're presented with a specific problem, with the solution provided. Then, you're asked to apply the solution that you've just learnt to a different problem.

## About This Site

Few things to be aware while going through this website:

1. There are two types of code examples: one editable and the other just read only. These small code snippets will be handy for you to tweak the code sligthly and see how it works.

```jsx live noInline
function Container({ children }) {
  return <div style={{ padding: 12 }}>{children}</div>;
}

function ExampleComponent() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <strong>Hello World! I am editable!</strong>
    </Container>
  );
}

render(<ExampleComponent />);
```

```jsx
function StaticComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <strong>You can see, but can't touch me!</strong>
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. However, when doing exercise, my advice is to copy those code into the code editor that you use usually code in. Why? Because [information is easier to be recalled when the context matches][recall-context], and I want you to recall what you learn here the next time you're coding.

In the event that you're attending live session of this workshop and your laptop is not setup previously by installing Node.js and npm, use this [link][new-react-sandbox] to create a project in CodeSandbox and then focus on the session.
