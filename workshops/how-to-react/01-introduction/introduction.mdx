Welcome!

This course is a brief introduction to React JS.

It takes a problem-solving centered approach, whereby you're presented with a specific problem, with the solution provided. Then, you're asked to apply the solution that you've just learnt to a different problem.

## What You Will Learn

- Core API of React
- common use cases when using React JS e.g. making api call, routing, testing, code splitting
- React hook feature

## This Course will NOT Cover

- Basics of HTML, CSS, & Javascript
- React Class Component
- Advanced React Patterns e.g. Higher Order Components and Render Props
- Tooling to use with React, e.g. webpack, Babel, ESLint. We'll use Create React App to abstract away all the tooling. If you're interested to learn about those tools, refer to the [Introduction to React][intro-to-react-js] course.
- Redux
- Typescript/Flow

<aside>

If you plan to look for a job in React developer today, it is important to learn React class component because most codebases out there still use it. However, it is getting less important as time passes as React hooks make them obsolete, since React hooks is a much better mechanism and cover 99% of the use case. You can refer to [Introduction to React][intro-to-react-js] course if you're interested.

## Prerequisite

This course assumes that:

- you have at least basic understanding of HTML/CSS/JS. If you know how to add a button element in a HTML and a script tag to make clicking the button do something interactive like a popup, then you're good to go. If you're not ready, go through this [Introduction to Web Development][intro-to-webdev] course.
- you have skim through the contents of the [JavaScript: The React Parts][js-the-react-parts] course and familiar with all the concepts. The more familiar with the concepts of that course, the more you will absorb from this course.

## About This Site

Few things to be aware while going through this website:

1. There are two types of code examples: one editable and the other just read only (use the icon on top left to differentiate them). For both types, you can use the copy button at top right to copy the code to your clipboard.

```jsx live noInline
function Container({ children }) {
  return <div style={{ padding: 12 }}>{children}</div>;
}

function ExampleComponent() {
  return (
    <Container>
      <strong>Hello World! I am editable!</strong>
    </Container>
  );
}

render(<ExampleComponent />);
```

```jsx
function StaticComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <strong>You can see, but can't touch me!</strong>
    </div>
  );
}
```

2. However, when doing exercise, my advice is to copy those code into the code editor that you usually use. Why? Because [information is easier to be recalled when the context matches][recall-context], and I want you to recall what you learn here the next time you're coding.

In the event that you're attending live session of this workshop and your laptop is not setup previously by installing Node.js and npm, use this [link][new-react-sandbox] to create a project in CodeSandbox and then focus on the session.
