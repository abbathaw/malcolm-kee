## Create a div containing 'Hello World!' with JavaScript

Without React:

```js
const rootEl = document.getElementById('js-hello-root');
const element = document.createElement('div');
element.className = 'container';
element.textContent = 'Hello World!';

rootEl.innerHTML = '';
rootEl.appendChild(element);
```

<div style="margin: 24px 0;">
  <div id="js-hello-root"></div>
</div>

With React:

```js
const rootEl = document.getElementById('react-hello-root');
const element = React.createElement(
  'div',
  {
    className: 'container',
  },
  'Hello World!'
);

ReactDOM.render(element, rootEl);
```

<div style="margin: 24px 0;">
  <div id="react-hello-root"></div>
</div>

The easiest way to include React in a HTML file is to add the following scripts tag into your HTML:

```html
<script
  crossorigin
  src="https://unpkg.com/react@16/umd/react.development.js"
></script>
<script
  crossorigin
  src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@16/umd/react-dom.development.js"
></script>
```

Which will expose `React` and `ReactDOM` as global variable.

Let's log the content of `element` and see what is it:

```javascript
{
    $$typeof: Symbol(react.element)
    key: null,
    // highlight-start
    props: {
        className: 'container',
        children: 'Hello World!'
    },
    // highlight-end
    ref: null,
    // highlight-next-line
    type: 'div',
    _owner: null,
    _store: {
        validated: false
    }
}
```

Which is actually just a JavaScript object. Note that the `type` and `props` are what we provided to `React.createElement` call.

## Using JSX

By using JSX, we can make it easier to mentally translate the React code with the generated HTML:

```js
const rootEl = document.getElementById('react-jsx-root');
const element = <div className="container">Hello World!</div>;

ReactDOM.render(element, rootEl);
```

<div style="margin: 24px 0;">
  <div id="react-jsx-root"></div>
</div>

## Problem: Migration of an Existing Application to use React

Now that you know how to render HTML with React, let's do it to a bigger page.

Let's migrate the feed from [BugBook] to our React App.

![The feed of BugBook will be implemented with React](bugbook-feed.png)

## Copy-Paste HTML to React

We will migrate the feed by copy pasting the HTML and then tweak the html slightly to follow React JSX rules:

1. all tags must be matched with closing tag or self-closing.
1. `class` attribute should be changed to `className`.

At this point of time, you may think, hey, I'm just translating HTML into this weird React JSX syntax, what's the big deal?

## Translation of Data and View

React is created to solve one problem: the translation between dynamic data and what is displayed in UI as HTML.

Assuming you have a data like below:

```javascript
const data = {
  name: 'Malcolm',
  greeting: 'Hello',
};
```

How are you going to translate each record to a HTML element like below?

```html
<div class="greeting">
  <p><span>Malcolm</span> says: <span>Hello</span></p>
</div>
```

We can do that with React like below:

```js
const data = {
  name: 'Malcolm',
  greeting: 'Hello',
};
const root = document.getElementById('root-3');
const element = (
  <div className="greeting">
    <p>
      <span>{data.name}</span> says: <span>{data.greeting}</span>
    </p>
  </div>
);

ReactDOM.render(element, root);
```

<div style="margin: 24px 0;">
  <div id="root-3"></div>
</div>

Now what if data is dynamic and will be change?

```javascript
data.name = 'Matthew';

// oh no, the greeting panel is outdated!
```

Because React is all JavaScript, we can wrap the previous createElement into a function and call it again:

```js
const data = {
  name: 'Malcolm',
  greeting: 'Hello',
};

function renderApp() {
  const element = (
    <div className="greeting">
      <p>
        <span>{data.name}</span> says: <span>{data.greeting}</span>
      </p>
    </div>
  );
  const root = document.getElementById('root-4');

  ReactDOM.render(element, root);
}

renderApp(); // render with initial data

// Uncomment the following lines to see the content is changed!
// data.name = 'Matthew';
// renderApp();
```

<div style="margin: 24px 0;">
  <div id="root-4"></div>
</div>

The great thing about React is, we just need to rerun the function to generate all the React elements (which is just a bunch of JavaScript objects), and React will figure out what is the difference between the previous `ReactDOM.render` and only make the changes related to the difference.

The whole approach of React (`React.createElement` and `ReactDOM.render`) is to generate a data structure to represents the DOM, which is known as virtual DOM.

## Virtual DOM

Virtual DOM is representation of DOM in memory. Since DOM structure is a tree, therefore virtual DOM structure is also a tree. `React.createElement` is used to create a node in virtual DOM tree.

`ReactDOM.render` what we call rendering engine, which means it translates virtual DOM to the actual DOM element.

One way to look at it is imagining your UI is a picture:

- `React.createElement` is to generate a pixel in the picture, so everytime you run the function it will create a new picture.
- `ReactDOM.render` will put your picture in the DOM. Besides, `ReactDOM` doesn't just replace the picture (because adding and removing DOM is expensive when there are many elements), instead, `ReactDOM` will spot the difference between the previous picture, mark them, and then only do the changes for the difference.

## Problem: Extract out the data in BugBook post

## React component as UI building block

Create `Card` component.

### props - input to React component

### props can be any data type in JavaScript

callback

### `children` props

Utilize `children` props.

### Exercise

Let's apply what you learn by implementing pokemon list in [Vanilla Pokemon App][vanilla-pokemon].

![Pokemon List in Vanilla Pokemon App](vanilla-pokemon-list.png)

Note: You only need to show the first 9 pokemon. You do not need to include the "Load More" functionality; it will be covered in coming sections.
