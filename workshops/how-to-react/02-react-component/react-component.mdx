## Problem: Migration of an Existing Application to use React

We will start to write React code by migration page from HTML to use React.

Let's migrate the feed from [BugBook] to our React App.

![The feed of BugBook will be implemented with React](bugbook-feed.png)

## Copy-Paste HTML to React

We will migrate the feed by copy pasting the HTML and then tweak the html slightly to follow React JSX rules:

1. all tags must be matched with closing tag or self-closing.
1. `class` attribute should be changed to `className`.

## React component as UI building block

Create `Card` component.

### `children` props

Utilize `children` props.
