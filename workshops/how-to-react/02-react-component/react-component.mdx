## Problem: Migration of an Existing Application to use React

We will start to write React code by migration page from HTML to use React.

Let's migrate the feed from [BugBook] to our React App.

## Copy-Paste HTML to React

We will migrate the feed by copy pasting the HTML and then tweak the html slightly to follow React JSX rules:

1. all tags must be matched with closing tag or self-closing.
1. `class` attribute should be changed to `className`.

## Virtual DOM and JSX

Virtual DOM is representation of DOM in memory. As DOM data structure is a tree, therefore virtual DOM structure is also a tree. `React.createElement` is used to create a node in virtual DOM tree.

JSX is an abstraction over `React.createElement` and nothing else.

`ReactDOM.render` what we call rendering engine, which means it translates virtual DOM to the actual DOM element.

## React component as UI building block

Create `Card` component.

### props - input to React component

### props can be any data type in JavaScript

callback

### `children` props

Utilize `children` props.

### Exercise

Let's apply what you learn by implementing pokemon list in [Vanilla Pokemon App][vanilla-pokemon].

Note: You only need to show the first 9 pokemon. You do not need to include the "Load More" functionality; it will be covered in coming sections.
