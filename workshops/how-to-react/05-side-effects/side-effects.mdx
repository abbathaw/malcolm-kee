The paradigm of using pure function to map props and states to virtual DOM is nice, but many JS application need to deal with things other than just displaying HTML element, such as:

- making ajax calls to retrieve the data from a API
- make connection to socket and listen for changes
- make call to some DOM api such as `window.scrollTo`.

In short, making side effects.

How do we make side effects in React pure function world?

## useEffect

## useEffect dependencies
