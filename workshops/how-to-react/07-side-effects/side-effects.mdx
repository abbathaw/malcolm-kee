The paradigm of using pure function to map props and states to virtual DOM is nice, but many JS application need to deal with things other than just displaying HTML element, such as:

- making ajax calls to retrieve the data from a API
- make connection to socket and listen for changes
- make call to some DOM api such as `window.scrollTo`.

In short, making side effects.

How do we ask React component that is a pure function to make side effects?

## useEffect

load data from API

example: bug list

## useEffect dependencies

data that is static

data that is dependent on props/states

- depends on state: load more bugs in bug list

- depends on props: edit bug in bug list

## useEffect cleanup

effect that requires cleanup:

- expand a specific post and update title
- add overflow class to body

## How to Think About useEffect

React manages DOM element side effects, `useEffect` manages other side effects.

### Exercise

load data of pokemon from ajax

Pokemon focus and update title

load more pokemon data from remote
